# Spin-Dressing
Simulation and Animation of Spin Dressing and Critical spin Dressing. For more information on spin dressing check my thesis:

I used Python to do spin dressing simulation and animations.\
In Spin dressing technique you can modify the gyromagnetic ratio. You can make it smaller (positive)
[Animation 1: Positive Gyromagnetic Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiqRMX0nIhQ)
[Animation 2: Positive Gyromagnetic Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyd_FxOrCf4)

Or zero!

[Animation 3: Zero Gyromagnetic Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOi7MLmp728)
[Animation 4: Zero Gyromagnetic Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2akxwL6yRY)

Or smaller (negative)!

[Animation 5: Negative Gyromagnetic Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB0gY3PAUek)

Or even larger! this regime is not as easy as the previous ones to explain by theory.

What is Spin dressing?

This is a technique in which you can modify the gyromagnetic ratio of a particle.
The idea of modifying the gyromagnetic ratio of a spin system by applying time-dependant
magnetic fields might seem strange but the idea is well-established and dates to work done
in the 1960s by C. Cohen-Tannoudji and S. Haroche [1]. When a spin-1/2 particle simultaneously
interacts with a weak static magnetic field and a strong but off-resonant oscillating
magnetic field, which is called the dressing field, then it precesses about the static field at
a time-averaged rate that is different than the Larmor precession frequency. It is this timeaveraged
precession frequency that is meant when one talks about a modified, apparent, or
dressed precession frequency. This situation can be viewed as if the particle has a modified
or apparent gyromagnetic ratio. It is thus common to refer to the particle as a dressed
particle. One can certainly apply a dressing field to two spin species simultaneously, and
in principle it should be possible to tune the modified gyromagnetic ratios of the two to be
equal. This special condition is referred to as a Critical Spin Dressing (CSD) condition.
